        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>Below is a list of links to pages on your LibGuides that have broken links or misspellings. <br />
        Any reports highlighted in pink indicate broken links/misspellings that were present in last monthâ€™s report. <br />
        You will have 2 weeks from today to update these pages (any pages highlighted in pink), or provide justification for why they cannot be fixed. <br />
        If no action is taken, or if no justification is provided, the parent pages will be unpublished (hidden from public view).</p>

        <p><strong>Broken Links:</strong></p>
        <div><!-- TABLE_PLACEHOLDER --></div>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
