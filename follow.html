        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>This is a follow-up regarding the broken links and misspellings listed in the report sent two weeks ago. 
        As per our previous communication, you were given two weeks to either update the affected pages or provide justification for why they couldn't be fixed.<br />
        If the necessary updates have been made, we appreciate your prompt action. If not, we would like to kindly remind you that these pages will be unpublished (hidden from public view) unless a justification is provided.
        Please ensure that any outstanding issues are addressed immediately. <br />
        If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. We're here to help. <br />
        Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
